# Lunch & Learn

An optional meeting every sprint that occur during lunch (or before/after), it
could also be a morning meeting depending on what the best time is for the team.

Generally, videos are proposed by the team and are watched together using:
https://www.watchparty.me/. Afterwards, the team talks about the video, their
initial impressions, and any takeaways if it's related to our day-to-day work.
