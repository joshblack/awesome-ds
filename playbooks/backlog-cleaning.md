# Backlog cleaning

**Duration:** 1hr

**Participants:** Design, Development

## About

Backlog cleaning is a biweekly meeting that focuses on the following parts of aspects of maintaining Carbon:

- Verifying that issues in the backlog have been triaged
- Categorizing bug reports in terms of severity and impact
- Reviewing feature requests and progressing them either to "needs more research" where our team will investigate/dive in or "accepted" where we believe this addition should be made to the project

These issues span across the design system and website repositories. This process is successful when we as a team:

- Have few or no issues that need to be triaged
- Are able to effectively prioritize high-impact bug fixes and bring them into the current sprint or a future sprint as a sized task
- Are able to effectively prioritize feature requests and bring them into a future sprint as a sized task with a timeline we can communicate to external teams

## Process

In general, when closing issues make sure to leave a clear comment as to why the issue was closed. If there is something actionable for the author, clearly articulate what they must do and what will change as a result of that action.

### Triaging Issues

### Proposals

- If an author has been inactive, follow these steps:
    - Add the "waiting for author's response" label on the issue
    - If the issue already has that label, and it's been more than 31 days, try and see if we are able to reach out to them on Slack
    - If we are able to reach out to them, request that they respond to the issue
    - If we are not able to reach out to them, close the issue and state that this is due to lack of activity and that they should reach out on Slack (if an IBMer) or Discord (if they are not an IBMer)

Questions

- Is there a pipeline for high-priority bugs?
- Is the expectation that during your support day you still triage issues?
- Should all disciplines be involved in sizing?
    - Idea: once a quarter do larger planning events/activities
    - Once everyone gets comfortable with sizing, we can more accurately estimate our own timeline/roadmap
- If we start doing this issue-by-issue, maybe we could start on the back side of things? (We're doing a pretty good job right now with recent issues)
    - "Clear out the pipes"
- There's a lot of stuff that's really old, is it even still relevant? Do we need an issue purge?
