# Retrospectives

Retrospectives are our process for iterating on how we work as a team. They are
ran every other week at the end of the sprint and include activities for
figuring out what went well, what needs to change, and action items for
coordinating those changes.

Each retrospective has a lead who runs the activities during a session. They are
responsible for the action items that come up during these activities and
figuring out how to address them in the following sprint. At the end of each
retrospective, the lead will pick someone to lead the retro for the next sprint.

**Setup**

- [ ] Go to the team Mural Dashboard
- [ ] Create a Mural with the format: <Year> Sprint <Number> Retro from the
      retro template
- [ ] Reach out to the previous retro facilitator so they can populate action
      items from previous retro

**Running the retro**

- [ ] At the beginning of each retro, the previous Retro Lead will kick us off
      with a recap of action items from last time and any resolutions for them
- [ ] Next, the Retro Lead will do a round robin with all the participants in
      the retro. This process is one where team members can share openly about
      the sprint, any challenges that they ran into, shoutouts that they want to
      do for other team members, etc.
- [ ] Afterwards, the Retro Lead should move to the activities starting with
      "What went well"
- [ ] Start the timer for 3 minutes and have team members fill out the section
- [ ] Next, move on to "What didn't go well". Start the timer for 3 minutes and
      have team members fill out the section
- [ ] Once both sections are filled out, find volunteers to cluster each
      section. Set a timer for about 3 minutes, adding more time as needed
- [ ] Once the timer goes off, have the volunteers play back each section
