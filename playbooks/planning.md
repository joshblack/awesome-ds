# Planning

We try and plan work out for a given iteration. Work gets prioritized through a consensus between leadership, OM, and the squad. The majority of our time as a squad should be spent focusing on business outcomes as described by OM. The rest of the time should go towards maintenance, quality-of-life updates, feature enhancements that aren't in-scope but are still important, and [passion fruits](https://twitter.com/movito/status/1227376296176553985). 

Each iteration plan is drafted under our Iterations page. When finalized, we share it as a pinned GitHub issue. What goes into an iteration can change as priorities shift, but it's important that the group maintains focus on only 3-5 key things to achieve during the cycle.

During each cycle, there will be goals that the squad need to deliver on that have exact issues or epics associated with them. However, there will also be time for support and maintenance that does not have to be determined at the beginning of a cycle. Instead, we'll continuously triage these types of issues or bug fixes so that the most important ones are at the top of Zenhub.

During a cycle, work can be prioritized or de-prioritized as needed. In particular, if something is blocking another squad's work for this cycle we have the ability to prioritize that work if we feel like it is scoped and deliverable without detracting from our broader goals.
