# Planning

We try and plan work out for a given iteration. Work gets prioritized through a
consensus between leadership, OM, and the squad. The majority of our time as a
squad should be spent focusing on business outcomes as described by OM. The rest
of the time should go towards maintenance, quality-of-life updates, feature
enhancements that aren't in-scope but are still important, and
[passion fruits](https://twitter.com/movito/status/1227376296176553985).

Each iteration plan is drafted under our Iterations page. When finalized, we
share it as a pinned GitHub issue. What goes into an iteration can change as
priorities shift, but it's important that the group maintains focus on only 3-5
key things to achieve during the cycle.

During each cycle, there will be goals that the squad need to deliver on that
have exact issues or epics associated with them. However, there will also be
time for support and maintenance that does not have to be determined at the
beginning of a cycle. Instead, we'll continuously triage these types of issues
or bug fixes so that the most important ones are at the top of Zenhub.

During a cycle, work can be prioritized or de-prioritized as needed. In
particular, if something is blocking another squad's work for this cycle we have
the ability to prioritize that work if we feel like it is scoped and deliverable
without detracting from our broader goals.

**What does our group plan?**

Our group is responsible for planning what functionality and fixes we are going to ship periodically throughout the year. This work benefits product teams that are using Carbon today either by adding in new functionality that they can leverage or by fixing issues that they may encounter.

Planning is responsible for the sequencing of proposed functionality and fixes that come into our team. Unfortunately, we're not able to build or fix every issue that comes into our project. As a result, we have to prioritize what gets implemented based on several factors depending on the type of work.

**What types of planning do we do as a team?**

Our team does planning at several different layers with increasing specificity as we go down the ladder. These layers include:

- Yearly planning, what direction overall guides our work for the year? (A vision statement, OKRs)
- Quarterly planning, what specific milestones are we going to hit in this quarter?
- Sprint planning, what specific milestones are we going to hit in this sprint?
    - Triage

Depending on the milestone, we may also do specific types of planning for a given project area. For example, if we are shipping a new major release that would require planning and coordination specific to that area.
