# Process

Our sprints last for 2 weeks with the following structure, with a week off each
quarter for OKR planning:

- **Week 1**
  - Handle final release from previous cycle and any release announcements
  - Kick-off sprint
  - Go through open issues and proposals as a team on Fridays
- **Week 2**
  - Planning for next sprint on Fridays
  - Retro

Each week, we have the following responsibilities:

- Coordinate on Monday of each week, ideally spending <30min talking about goals
  for the week in the context of the sprint
- Check-in during the week on goal status through round robins
- Spend approximately 5-10% of their time on customer support, including:
  - Answering questions on Slack
  - Answering questions on GitHub
  - Triaging issues on GitHub

For each release cycle, we will need to:

- Have a release lead to help coordinate a specific release
- Create a release-specific issue for the target version
- Have a design, development, and content representative to help verify the
  release and identify any stop-ship issues

Squad leads have the following responsibilities:

- Organizing iteration activities like design crit, planning, round robins,
  retros, etc.
- Contributing to planning and providing status updates on progress
- Handling prioritization shuffles if things come up during a cycle
- Working with OM to align on business goals during planning and execution

**Squad goals**

Working against objectives or goals for Carbon set at the leadership, squad, or
individual level. This breaks down into 60% of time spent working towards
business results set by OM, and 40% of time spent towards maintenance,
development, and support for the design system.

**Support**

Assist customers who are looking for help or guidance with the system, or are
running into issues while using the system.

**Personal growth**

Develop skills as they relate to your craft, grow eminence through writing or
speaking, attend events to help you reach the next jump in your career.Note:
it's important that skill development is tied towards a discrete business goal.
For example, instead of "learn skill X" we would say "use skill X to do Y",
where Y is a goal or objective.

**Meetings**

We get it, they totally happen. Meetings are an essential part of collaboration
to stay in sync and on track. Use sparingly, and try and keep meetings short
(15-30min) if possible.
