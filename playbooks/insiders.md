# Insiders

**Who you are**

- You're a team invested in helping your broader group achieve better outcomes
- You've invested your time and effort into building with, or on top of, the
  Carbon Design System
- You're curious about how to best build on top of Carbon, and want to learn
  from other groups who are doing similar things
- You're willing to invest your own time to help build a better ecosystem

**What we do**

- A monthly meetup for all teams who are building on top of Carbon to discuss
  best practices, areas to consolidate, and things Carbon can do to make your
  jobs easier
- Organize around release cycles to help minimize unintended side-effects or
  changes propagating through the ecosystem
