# Support

### Overview

Support is one of the primary benefits we give to those who use Carbon at IBM. IBMers interact with us across many communication channels, but the support that we offer will be specific to Slack and GitHub. It's important that our group adheres to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when interacting with coworkers across these communication channels, as well as flag individuals who are not adhering to our code of conduct.

For developers on the system squad, you will be assigned one day each week as your "support" day. There will be a reminder in Slack that will ping you at the start of your support day. The squad will rotate support days once a month.

On your support day, you will be responsible for the following:

- Coordinating the answer for questions asked on Slack
- Coordinating the triage of issues on GitHub

### Slack support

For Slack support, developers on support are expected to monitor the Carbon channels for development-related questions.

For those new to the squad, or for those unfamiliar with a question that is being asked, it is your responsibility during your support day to figure out how to get an answer. 

In order to do this, you can:

- Reach out to fellow developers or designers to help assist in helping you understand the question
- Include specific developers or designers if you know that someone is working on a question topic recently
- Reach out in the following channels if you're unsure how to get an answer, reach out in our squad or support channel on Slack.

### GitHub support

For GitHub support, you are expected to help triage new issues that have been submitted on your support day across the following repos:

- [https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon)
- [https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website)

To learn more about our triage process, you can view our support guide [here](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/master/docs/guides/support.md#issues).

In general, there will be the following categories of issues that you may run into:

- Enhancements
- Bug reports
- Questions

For enhancements, if they come from our team members you can safely ignore them. If they come from outside contributors, you will need to:

- [ ]  Verify that they have filled out the issue template
- [ ]  Add the proposal: open label
- [ ]  Move the issue to the proposal pipeline in ZenHub

For bug reports, you will need to:

- [ ]  Verify that they have filled out the issue template and provided a codesandbox link to help with reproducing (if applicable)
- [ ]  Verify that the bug exists
- [ ]  If possible, provide potential steps to fix the bug
- [ ]  Follow our big triage process outlined in the support guide above to add relevant severity and impact labels

For questions, you will need to:

- [ ]  Assign yourself to the question
- [ ]  Try and determine the answer to the question, if you are unsure feel free to reach out using the support channels noted above for Slack support

### FAQ

- What should I do if I'm out-of-office on my support day?
    
    If you're planning to take vacation time then you should pre-arrange with someone on the team to cover you for your support day. If you're unable to find someone, reach out to a manager who can help coordinate a replacement.
